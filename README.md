# LaTeX-Resume

An example of my personal resume made with LaTeX, compiled and published into **Github Pages** with a **Github Action**:

https://dfsmania.github.io/LaTeX-Resume/

The site available on the **Github Pages** contains a customized version of the [Start Bootstrap Resume Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume), to provide a web version of my resume with a link to the compiled _LaTeX_ document.
